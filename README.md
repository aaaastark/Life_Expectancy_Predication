**Life Expectancy Prediction**
* Life expectancy refers to the average age a person is estimated to live and is an important factor to determine the population health of any country. In the pre-modern world, Life expectancy was very less close to about 30 years but after 19th Century life expectancy started to increase and it nearly doubled.
* The project tries to create a model based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the life expectancy for different countries in years. The data offers a timeframe from 2000 to 2015.

**Python Libraries and Dataset**
* Sklearn, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Scipy, Pycounty_Convert, Matplotlib, Numpy.  Life Expectancy Data (.csv)
